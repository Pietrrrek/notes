#itpweek1 
## Chapter objectives
- **Define what a methodology is and the role it serves**
    - A methodology is a template or game plan for starting (initiating), planning and developing a product of information system. 
- **Describe the Project Life Cycle (PLC)**
    - Every project goes through the following parts
        - **Define Project Goal** - at the start of the project, the goal should be clearly defined. The envisioned (expected) business value of the project should be clearly visible (explicit) once the project goal has been defined.
        - **Plan Project** - the project's goal provides direction for planning the project. The project plan defines the projet's objectives, resources and controls. The objectives are things such as the project's scope, schedule, budget and desired quality. Resources include things such as people, facilities, and technology. Controls refers to controlling that the project objective are being met and that resources are being used efficiently and effectively, the risk, change and communication among project-stakeholders should also be actively managed (controlled) throughout the project. 
        - **Execute Project Plan** - once the project plan has been approved it can be executed. The execution-phase includes the design, development and delivery of the project's product or system. 
        - **Close and Evaluate Project** - once the product of the project has been delivered the project should be closed (finished) and evaluated. During evaluation it is important to check whether the previously defined project goal has been achieved. Any knowledge gained throughout the project, such as best practices, should be documented and made available for future projects.
- **Describe the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK®) and be familiar with its knowledge areas and process groups.**
    - The PMBOK Guide defines ten knowledge areas for understanding project management.
        - **Project integration management** - integration focuses on the project plan's development, execution, and control of changes
        - **Project scope management** - a project's scope is the work that is to be completed by the project team. The scope may include specific requirements, features, functionality or standards that the product must adhere to. The scope could also include project-related deliverables such as the project's  budget or schedule. ==Scope management ensures that the project's work is clearly and accurately defined and that it is completed on time==. 
        - **Project time management** - time management includes identifying the project's phases and activities and then estimating, sequencing and assigning resources for each activity in a way which ensures that the project's scope and objectives are met. 
        - **Project cost management** - cost management ensures that the project's budget is developed and completed as approved.
        - **Project quality management** - quality management focuses on planing, developing and managing a quality environment in which the stakeholder's needs and expectations can be met. 
        - **Project human resource management** - Since people are the most important resource in a project, resource management focuses on creating and developing a project team as well as understanding and responding appropriately to the behavioral side of project management. 
        - **Project communications management** - communication management includes communicating accurately and in a timely manner about the project the the project's stakeholders.
        - **Project risk management** - risk management is focused on identifying and responding to risks that can impact the project.
        - **Project procurement management** - acquisition management makes certain that the required resources are readily available when needed.
        - **Project stakeholder management** -  Stakeholder management focuses on identifying project stakeholders to better understand their expectations or interests, and then developing appropriate strategies for communication and managing potential conflicts.
- **Describe PRINCE2® and be familiar with its core principles, processes, and themes.**
- **Describe the Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC).**
- **Describe the Waterfall method for developing the project’s product or system.**
- **Describe the Agile approach for developing the project’s product or system as well as two commonly used approaches called eXtreme Programming (XP) and Scrum.**
- **Describe and apply the concept of Learning Cycles and lessons learned.**
