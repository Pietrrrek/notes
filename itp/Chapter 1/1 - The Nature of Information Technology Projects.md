# The Nature of Information Technology Projects
#itpweek1 
## Chapter objectives
- **Understand why information technology (IT) project are organizational investments.**
    - When a company undertakes an IT-project it invests time, money and resources in expectation of achieving a certain goal - similar to how an investor invests money in a company with the goal of earning more money.
- **Understand why projects are planned organizational change and why they must align with an organization's business strategy.**
    - Business strategies support the vision and mission of the organization. An effective business strategy is required in order for an organization to be successful. ==Projects are the planned organizational changes or means for achieving a chosen strategy.==
- **Define what a project is and describe the attributes of a project.**
    - *A project is a temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, service, or result.*
    - *A project manager is the person assigned by the performing organization to lead the team that is responsible for achieving the project objectives.*
    - **[[Project attributes]]**
- **Define the discipline called project management.**
    - *Project management is the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to project activities to meet project requirements.*
- **Understand the relationship among project portfolios, programs, and projects.**
    - **Project portfolios** are collections of projects, ==an organization should aim to have a diversified portfolio==. Organizations should seek to balance their project portfolio with respect to risk, experience and technology. Having a portfolio compromised of low-risk projects using old soon-out-of-market technologies could be detrimental to the organizations market-competitiveness.
    - Some projects within an organizations portfolio may be independent and not directly related to one another, conversely, some projects are managed as a **program**. In a program the projects' activates are coordinated so that the benefits of the whole program outweigh the sum benefits of the individual projects.
        - *"For example, an organization may approve a project to move its existing data center to a new building. On its own, this could be an individual project. However, if the project to move the data center is part of a strategic plan to integrate a new supply chain system and customer support system, then a single project that includes moving the data center and development of two systems may be too risky. Instead of planning and managing the data center move, supply chain system, and customer support system as one large project, it may be wiser and saner to coordinate this collectively as a program of three interdependent projects. Each project would have its own project manager, team, budget, schedule, and so forth with a shared governance structure in place for resolving issues and conflicts and to ensure that each project aligns with the overall success of the program (1)."*
- **Understand how the disciplines of information technology and project management have evolved together and have led to how we manage projects today.**
- **Understand the current state of IT project management.**
    - Many projects fail in terms of delivering the product on time, within budget and supporting all promised/envisioned features.
- **Understand why some projects fail and how to improve the likelihood of success.**
    - Some projects are classified as failures **due to strict requirements set by the studies which evaluate the successfulness of the projects**
    - Projects rarely fail due to one singular reason
    - Reasons for a projects failure usually fall into one of four groups, *People, Processes, Technology, Organization*
        -  The first category *People* refers to the people involved in the projects including major stakeholders such as project sponsors, the project group and the users of the end-product.
        -  The *Processes* category refers to the execution of the project.
        -  The *Technology* category refers to which technologies are involved in the project. The technology can be the cause of failure if it is either obsolete (old), unproven (e.g. used before maturity) or incompatible with some other part of the system. **Only 3% of IT project failures are caused by technical challenges** 
        -  The last category *Organization* refers to cases where the organization has no clear strategy or funds the wrong project etc.
    - The likelihood of success can be improved through taking a different approach
        - **A value driven approach** - Instead of measuring success in terms of schedule or budget, it should be measured in terms of how much value it brings to the organization. A project can go over budget and schedule and still be successful if it brings real value to the organization.
        - **A socio-technical approach** - The project should not be a purely technical endeavor. The developers of the project should understand the business in order to bring value to the organization. The end-users should also be encouraged to participate and involve themselves in the project by sharing their visions.
        - **A project-management approach** - [[Project management]] should be a crucial part of the IT-project instead of simply developing systems on an ad hoc basis. By implementing proper project management into IT-projects, we gain a common language for discussing and comparing projects throughout the entire organization. 
        - **A knowledge-management approach** - knowledge needs to be managed in order to be easily accessible to anyone needing it. Knowledge management is a systematic process for acquiring, creating, synthesizing, sharing, and using information, insights, and experiences to transform ideas into business value
