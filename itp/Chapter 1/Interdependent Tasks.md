The work needed in order to deliver a product often requires many interdependent tasks, i.e. tasks which cannot be started before some dependencies are resolved or requirements fulfilled e.g. installing a network requires that a server and other necessary hardware has been delivered. **As a result of interdependent tasks, the project's schedule may slip, and the project will not meet its planned deadline.**

Additionally certain project may be characterized by **progressive elaboration** where the details of a project become clearer as more information becomes available.
